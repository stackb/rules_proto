    This is a thin wrapper around aspect_rules_ts's ts_project macro. Note that the Gazelle rule only supports customizing
    the args and tsconfig attributes.

    Additionally, it is necessary to pass
    ```
    deps = [
            "//:node_modules/long",
            "//:node_modules/protobufjs",
    ],
    ```
    meaning one must call npm_link_all_packages in the BUILD file at the *root* of the workspace (or figure out how to set rootDirs
    appropriately).
